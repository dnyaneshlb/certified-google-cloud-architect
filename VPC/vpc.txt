VIMP
	Within our VPC network, all primary and secondary IP addresses must be unique. 
	But they don't need to be contiguous
	
	Subnet can be removed or replaced ONLY if not is use by any instance.
	
	Once created you can expand subnet but cannot shrink it.
	
	longest subnet mask you can use is 29.
	i.e. 10.0.0.0/10 --- valid
		 10.23.2.12/31 --- invalid
		 192.12.56.23/8 -- valid
		 
	for automatic subnets you cannot provide range above x.x.x.x/16
	i.e. you cannot expand subnet(default is x.x.x.x/20)
	
		 
		 
CIDR Range notation
	10.0.0.0/10
	first 10 bits are fixed rest can be changed.
	Above ip address in binary form -- 00001010.00000000.00000000.00000000
	So only 00001010.00 is fixed, rest digits can be anything.
	which essentially gives us 2^22 combinations.
	
Custom VPC cannot be converted into auto mode network but vice versa possible.

For external Ip address(internet facing machine), you can use either static reserved ip address or ephemeral ip address.
If you use 

	
Subnetworks :
	Subnet can span across multiple zones in a single region.
	first two and last two ip addresses in subnet are reserved.
		e.g. 172.168.0.0/29
		This subnet will have 8 ip address but 4 will be reserved leaving you with only 4 useful ip addresses.
	Subnets can grow but cant contract so avoid large subnets.
	
	Every vm in subnet needs an internal ip address and external ip address. Both Internal and external can be ephemeral or static.	
	see create instance in gui.
		
	
HA using VPC
	Keep VMs in diffrent zones within same VPC so that even if one zone is affected other will maitain HA
	
	USe multiregional architecture
	
Bastion Host
	bastion means defensive walls around fort
