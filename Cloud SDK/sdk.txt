https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/components

default components	
	gcloud, gsutil, bq
	Cloud SDK Core Libraries
	Note that alpha, beta components are not isntalled by default
	
	
Setting up SDK
	gcloud init
		Authorizes Cloud SDK tools to use your user account credentials to access Google Cloud
		Sets up a Cloud SDK configuration and sets a base set of properties
		
	If you want to change the account used in current gcloud configuration, you can run 
		gcloud auth login
		Here you will be redirected to web login page where you put username/passwrd.	
		
	But if you want to login with service account,
		gcloud auth activate-service-account [ACCOUNT] --key-file=[KEY_FILE]
		service accounts dont have username/password


Configurations
	A configuration is a named set of SDK properties. The gcloud CLI uses a configuration named "default" as the initial active configuration; default is suitable for most use cases. However, you can also create additional configurations and switch between them as required.
	
	
gcloud commands
	gcloud components list
	gcloud components install kubectl   (not installed by default)
	
	gcloud config set account dnyanesh4dd@gmail.com
	gcloud auth reovke accountname     -> removes from local
	gcloud config configurations create dev
	gcloud config configurations activate dev
	gcloud config unset project
	gcloud config list
	
	gcloud auth configure-docker
	gcloud auth application-credentials  - play around default application credentials
