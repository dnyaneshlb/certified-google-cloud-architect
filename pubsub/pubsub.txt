Complementing Pub/Sub, Pub/Sub Lite is a "zonal" service for messaging systems with predictable traffic patterns. If you publish 1 MiB-1 GiB of messages per second, Pub/Sub Lite is a low cost option for high-volume event ingestion.
Publishers send messages to Lite topics and subscribers receive messages from Lite subscriptions.
