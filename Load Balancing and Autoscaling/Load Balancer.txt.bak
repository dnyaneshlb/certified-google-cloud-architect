Choosing Load Balancer basedon traffic type?

Global vs regional load balancing
	Global load balancer requires to use premium network tier while regional can work with standard tier.

	Use global load balancing when your backends are distributed across multiple regions, your users need access to the same applications and content, and you want to provide access by using a single anycast IP address. 
	Global load balancing can also provide IPv6 termination hence it handles both ipv4 and ipv6 traffic.

	Use regional load balancing when your backends are in one region, and you only require IPv4 termination.

	Just see @Internal&_global_Load_balancing_demonstration.svg. its crystal clear.
	

External vs internal load balancing
	External load balancers distribute traffic coming from the internet to your Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. Global load balancing requires that you use the Premium Tier of Network Service Tiers. For regional load balancing, you can use Standard Tier.

	Internal load balancers distribute traffic to instances inside of Google Cloud.


Network load balancing allows you to balance the load of your systems based on incoming IP protocol data, such as address, port, and protocol type. You also get some options that are not available, with HTTP(S) load balancing. For example, you can load balance additional TCP/UDP-based protocols such as SMTP traffic. And if your application is interested in TCP-connection-related characteristics, network load balancing allows your app to inspect the packets, where HTTP(S) load balancing does not.

Global 
		Http(s) Load Balancing:
			Its global load balancing hence It allows you to load balance traffic coming from any device across globe.
			By default it routes requests to resource in a zone/region closest to the client location.
				But it also check the health of the resources running backed service before routing requests. So it is quite possible that a user sitting in Asia hits the request but the backend instances in that region are not healthy or dont have capacity, so load balancer can route requests to America backend servers.
				And this is called cross region load balancing.
			But you can define the URLmap which  allows you to route request to different set of instances based on custom logic.
				e.g. www.example.com/audio can be directed to one set of instances and
						 www.example.com/video can be directed to another
			Supports http port 80 and 8080
						   https port 443
						   both IPV4 and IPV6 addresses
						   
			How it works? https://youtu.be/jZQf97np114?t=88 (quite easy though)
			A question can be like,
			A company serving audio and video services, wants its global users to access their content but they want to keep same url. How to achieve this?
			Ans - They can use Global Http(s) load balancer which can route traffic based on content requested using a url header.
			
			A https load balancer required setting of signed SSL certificate on load balancer.
			
			
			
		SSL Proxy Load Balancer
			ITs a global load balancer used for encrypted traffic requirements.	
			
			
		TCP Proxy Load Balancer
			Its a global load balancer used for non encrypted TCP traffic requirements.	
	
Regional
		TCP/UDP Network Load Balancer
			Also called as just "Network Load Balancer"
			USed for traffic routing within a same region
			Its routes traffic based on ip address, port and protocol
			Its a non-proxied load balancer(as opposed to above one's)
