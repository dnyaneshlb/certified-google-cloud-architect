Father of all noSQL databases but used for analytics, super high throuput read/writes. 
Its first no SQL db internally used in google to power almost all google apps like gmail, maps, photos, calender etc.

Fully managed & clustered, you need to provision the nodes.
Low latency, massively scalable NoSQL

BigTable is priced by provisioned nodes. BigTable does not autoscale.

ACE** - The Compute Engine default service account is created with the Cloud IAM project editor role

To access big table, we can use HBase API.

Yuo can directly query bigtable from bigquery(similar to cloud sql, google drive, cloud storage)

Big query is read intensive while bigtable is write intensive.

You need to enter the number of BigTable nodes you'll provision.
BigTable is priced by provisioned nodes. BigTable does not autoscale. BigTable does not store its data in GCS



Bigtable has a limit of 1,000 tables per instance, but in most cases, you should have far fewer tables than that. Creating many small tables is a "Bigtable anti-pattern"

BigTable is a third dimensional database. Meaning, a cell can store many historical timestamped values. 

	
	
Architechture :
		https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/overview#architecture
	Instance
		An instance contain one or more clusters.
		

	cluster
		A cluster contain one or more nodes
		All clusters created under instance share instace properties like SDD/HDD storage, application profile etc.

	Node
		A node is a basic unit responsible for handling bigtable metadata. Note all data is stored in collosus and nodes are mere a medium to interact with underlying collusus file system.

	Storage
		HDD or SDD
