Audit logs help you find "who did what where and when??"

Types :
	Admin Activity Logs
	Data Access Logs
	System Event Logs
	Policy Denied Logs
	
	Admin Activity audit logs
		Generated for admin activity like create/delete resource, change iam permissions and so on.
		They are always written; you can't configure or disable them
		Even if you disable the Cloud Logging API, Admin Activity audits logs are still generated. 
		There is no charge for your Admin Activity audit logs
		
	Data Access audit logs	
		Generated for data access or reading the configuration or metadata of resources
		Disabled by default.
		Enabling the logs might result in your Cloud project being charged for the additional logs usage, hence enable these logs only for required services.
		
	System Event audit logs	
		Generated for Google Cloud actions taken by Google systems that modify the configuration of resources
		System Event audit logs are always written free of charge; you can't configure or disable them.
		
	Policy Denied audit logs	
		Generated for security policy violation.
		Policy Denied audit logs are generated by default and your Cloud project is charged for the logs storage
