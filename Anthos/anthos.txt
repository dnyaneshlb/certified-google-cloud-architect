Anthos enables you to run Kubernetes clusters anywhere, in any available public clouds(gcp, azure, aws) and on-premises environments. 

In a complex org, we have some apps in one cloud and some in other, while some monolith live in on prem env. It becomes hard to manage all these moving pieces together. Hence anthos. It enables you to work with you on prem clusters + any cloud kubenetes clusters together.
You dont need to build new clusters to run on anthos. You can Just bring existing k8s cloud/on-prem cluster directly to anthos as it.



Anthos can be run not only on google cloud but
GCP (Most feature rich)
AWS EC2 machines
Azure VMs
Attached Cluster
on-prem(GKE on-prem)
	VMware
	Bare Metal
	




Features
	Hybrid and multicloud kubenetes deployments
	Single pane og glass for management of all clusters in diff envs.
	It supports even windows containers
	
	
Multi Cluster Ingress 
	When an application resides in mulitple clusters across multiple clouds/on-prem systems, we can use this feature.
	Supports
		Single consistent virtual IP for application, regardless where its deployed.
		Proximity Based routing

What is service mesh and anthos service mesh?
	Its the old thing wrapped in new cloth
		Decopule the cross cutting concerns into a sidecar proxy so developers can focus on application then boilerplate code and design.
		It decouples things like below from application
			Observability
			Traffic management
			Security
