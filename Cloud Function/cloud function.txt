Serverless, event based, small single purpose processing 

billed nearest 100ms

can be written only in python, nodejs, java, .Net, Ruby, php and go.

Two types
	HTTP Function
		Functions that are triggered by HTTP requests are called HTTP functions.
	Background Function
		Functions that are triggered by event are called background functions
		for example, by a message being published to a Pub/Sub topic, a change in a Cloud Storage bucket, or a Firebase event.
	CloudEvent Function
		conceptually similar to background functions
		CloudEvent functions use an industry-standard event format known as CloudEvents
		Another such difference is that Cloud Functions itself invokes CloudEvent functions using HTTP requests

gcloud
	gcloud functions deploy myfunction
		--runtime python37 		
		--trigger-event=providers/cloud.firestore/eventTypes/document.write
		--allow-unauthenticated
		--memory=512MB
		--timeout=60

	gcloud functions call helloWorld  --data='{"message": "Hello World!"}'	
	
	gcloud functions logs read myfunction
		--limit=20
		--min-log-level=DEBUG


Supprted Events and triggers
	https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/events-triggers
	HTTP : call by http requests
	Cloud storage : finalize, delete, archieve, metadataUpdate
	Firstore : create, delete, update, write
	pubsub : topic.publish
	CLoud Logging : forward log entries to a Pub/Sub topic by creating a sink. You can then trigger the function
	firebase


Important Considertion for choosing CF
	By default, a function times out after 1 minute, but you can extend this period up to 9 minutes.
