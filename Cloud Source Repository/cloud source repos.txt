Its a private Git instance hosted on Google Cloud.

Features
	Unlimited repos with super fast search across all the repos 	
		functions, classes and all the entities are indexed
	
	Built in intergration with cloud build, Cloud Debugger, IAM

	You can connect an existing GitHub or Bitbucket repository to Cloud Source Repositories.

	Cloud Source Repositories automatically send logs of repository activity to Cloud Logging to help track and troubleshoot data access.

		
Cloud Source Repositories offer security key detection to block git push transactions that contain sensitive information. This feature is designed to improve the security of your source code.
	This is pretty important as you remember 82 delete protected VMs are spinned up in our dev project because someone publicly added service account key in repo.


With default IAM intergration, you can add roles (list repos, create repo, delete repo, push commits, create tag) to source contribtors for fine grained access.
