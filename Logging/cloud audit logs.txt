Cloud audit logs answer the questions of "who did what, where, and when?" within your Google Cloud resources.

Types
	Admin Activity
		Admin Activity audit logs are always written; you can't configure or disable them
		no charge, free.
		To view these logs, you must have the Cloud IAM role Logging/Logs Viewer or Project/Viewer.
	Data Access
		To view these logs, you must have the Cloud IAM roles "Logging/Private Logs Viewer or Project/Owner".
		Disabled by default because they can be quite large.
		Data Access audit logs do not record the data-access operations on resources that are publicly shared (available to "All Users" or "All Authenticated Users") or that can be accessed without logging into Google Cloud.
		types of data access logs : 
			Admin read, data read, data write

		System Event audit logs are always written; you can't configure or disable them.
