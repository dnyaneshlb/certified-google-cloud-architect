GCP a intrinsically global while AWS is region scoped.

Region :
	A region is a specific geographical location where you can host your resources. Each region has one or more zones; most regions have three or more zones. For example, the us-west1 region denotes a region on the west coast of the United States that has three zones: us-west1-a, us-west1-b, and us-west1-c.

Zone :
	Google designs zones to be independent from each other: a zone usually has power, cooling, networking, and control planes that are isolated from other zones, and most single failure events will affect only a single zone.
