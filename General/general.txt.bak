Labels vs tags
	Labels are used to organize the resources in gcp.
	They are key value pairs always
	e.g. dept: finance
		 env: prod
		 
	Tags are simple strings applied on resource(primarily networking resources).
	e.g. dev-network

Budgets in GCP are not a way to prevent spending or stop resources. They are a tool for raising awareness about the consumption of resources so that a business can implement its own consumption management processes.
e.g. when budget has spiked above 70% of monthly spend then shutdown or delete non required resources.
Note : Using 100% monthly budget will simply trigger notification to billing administrator. It wont prevent spending or stop resources.


External IP addresses that don’t fall under the Free Tier will incur a small cost. Also, as a general security best practice, it’s a good idea to use internal IP addresses where applicable.


Each project ID is unique across Google Cloud. 
Once you have created a project, you can delete the project but its ID can never be used again.
A project is associated with max one billing account but one billing account can be associated with multiple projects.

A project serves as a namespace. This means every resource within each project must have a unique name, but you can usually reuse resource names if they are in separate projects. Some resource names must be globally unique.

What is cloud identity?

		In a nutsehll this is what I used in firebase authentication for some apps/websites.

You must have a valid Cloud Billing account even if you are in your free trial period or if you only use Google Cloud resources that are covered by the Google Cloud Free Tier.		

Its is recommended 
		to have only one billing account unless absolutely required.
		to enable billing expoerts to big query on day one
		to Assign key roles to more than one person (reasonable redundancy)
