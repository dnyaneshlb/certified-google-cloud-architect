Cloud Identity is a stand-alone Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution. It gives Cloud Platform customers access to many of the identity management capabilities provided by Google Workspace.

It talks about having a single platform to do jobs like authentication, single sign on(be it google, facebook, email an so on) using a single platform.
