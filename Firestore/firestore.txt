This is enhanced version of Cloud Datastore. It can work in datastore mode for backword compatibility. It is compatible with all old datastore APIs and libraries.


Datastore vs Firestore
	Datastore :
		Data store provides SQL like queries (via GQL ~ similar to sql)
		Data store is not fully consistent
		Data store does not support joins or aggregates(like sum, count).
		Has Kinds ans entities
		offers unlimited writes per second
		
	Firestore
		Its a datastore++
		Offers datatore mode and native mode
		Supports offline data sync
		Has collections and documents
		Limits writes to 10000 docs per second(This is limit is to bring strong consistency)
		Supports millions of clients and offline updates
	
	
Common things in both modes,
	Single fields indexes are created automatically
	You have to create composite indexes based on your application need
	
	Key design for kind/collection is a crucial factor
	
	You can nest entities/documents inside another.
