GCP has quota to avoid extra useage of resources due to known reason or malicious activity.
They help us to avoid billing surprises.
Rate Quota
	The rate at which the resource us used for certain time. If rate quota exceeeds for that resource then we can take some action.
	e.g. 1000 admin req in 1 min for GKE cluster is rate quota. Its very unlikely for an admin to comsume more than allowed quota. If it does, something malicious is happning.	
	Rate quota expires after certain time then restarts.
Allocation Quota
	5 networks per project
