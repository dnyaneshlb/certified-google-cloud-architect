How its different from cloud storage?

	Objects do not reside within subdirectories in a bucket.
		For example, you can name an object /europe/france/paris.jpg to make it appear that paris.jpg resides in the subdirectory /europe/france, but to Cloud Storage, the object simply exists in the bucket and has the name /europe/france/paris.jpg. As a result, while deeply nested, directory-like structures using slash delimiters are possible within Cloud Storage, they don't have the performance that a native filesystem has when listing deeply nested sub-directories.
